Pack AI can be implemented by a master AI that decides how a particular pack behaves. 

PackStrength/Cohesion

Each pack will start with a strength that determines how well they work together. This value can be increased or reduced based on the events of a game.

Increases:
-pack successfully kills a player
-leader AI is present
-pack is closer together

Decreases:
-leader dies (large decrease)
-pack member dies
-pack too spread out

Once strength is reduced bellow a threshhold, the pack ai will be disabled and the units will think as individuals.
