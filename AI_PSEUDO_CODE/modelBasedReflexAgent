The format of a model based reflex agent

KEY DIFFERENCES FROM A simpleReflexAgent:
Knows what the world is like now:
	The agent has a state, meaning it has a persistent current conception of the world
		This conception is updated based of which sensors the agent has     // In our case, the sensors would be the types of info that it can register
	The agent known what its actions do to the world
	
Uses its state to then decide what action should be performed

function MODEL-BASED-RELFEX-AGENT(percept) returns an action
persistent: rules, a set of condition-action rules
	    model, a description of how the next state depends on current state and action
	    state, the agent's current perception of the world
	    action, the most recent action performed

state <-- UPDATE-STATE(state,action,percept,model)	 // The agent starts with an update of it's perception of the world
rule <-- RULE-MATCH(state,rules)  	 //   (THIS IS ESSENTIALLY THE CONDITIONAL NEST ALGORITHM EXCEPT THE RULES DEPEND ON THE STATE )
action <-- rule.Action
return action
