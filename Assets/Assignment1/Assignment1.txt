Create a simple platformer that spawns a player on a platform and allows them to jump from level to level. Your platformer should have the following features

 Character (10 Marks each)

    The character should always start at the same location
    The character should be an animated sprite with jump and walk animations as demonstrated in tutorial.
    The character should only collide with platform with its feet when going down. It should be able to jump straight up from one platform to another.
    The character should be able to walk up and down sloping platforms naturally (hint use a circular collider on the feet)
    If the character falls to the bottom of the screen it should die and respawn back at a starting location.
    The character should have 3 controls, walk left, walk right and jump
    The Character should use the adding FORCES method of movement discussed in the tutorials 

Environment (5 Marks each)

    The environment should be single screen only (no camera movement necessary)
    There should be three levels of platforms for the character to jump on
    There should be at least 7 platforms total covering no more than 75% of the length of any of the three levels
    At least two platforms should be sloped at approximately ±30° and have different coefficients of friction
    At least one platform should move either left to right or up and down
    There should be a background for the scene

 Bonus Marks (maximum possible for assignment 100%)

    Make one platform a bounce pad. If the character jumps while on the bounce pad, they get a significant height boost to their jump (5 Marks)
    Make one platform appear and disappear periodically (5 Marks)
    Use the animation blend feature to handle jumping and falling with the same animation structure as in tutorial, ie the animation should be triggered by a measurement of a state change of the player. (5 marks)
